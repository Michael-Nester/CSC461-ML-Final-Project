current experiments/results in prograssReport/Peliminaries

CSC461_ML_FinalProject_Test1.ipynb is code that utilizes files in a shared drive our group has, containing images of eyes. Before running, pay attention to where the code is retreiving the data, and where the code writes the results to, as you may want to change these paths.
