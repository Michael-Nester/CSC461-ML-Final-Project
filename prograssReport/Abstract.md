# Abstract

In recent years, the rapid advancements in machine learning, computer vision, and processing power have enabled people to make their wildest ideas into a reality. 
Amongst some of the most prominent ideas are generative imagery and A.I. image editing. 

The human eye is a fascinatingly unique part of our identity. The challenge of this project is to linearize as many unique features of the iris as possible, 
and provide a way to combine any of these features to your own eye. This project aims to utilize a robust machine learning model trained to
distinguish even the subtlest variations in eye color, and then allow people to use this model to edit the eye color of any face with ease.
